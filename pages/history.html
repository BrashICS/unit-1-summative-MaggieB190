    <h1> Life and Important History</h1>

    <p>
      <h2>George Boole's Life</h2>
      George Boole lived from 1815-1864 and worked as an English mathematician and philosopher. He was the first professor of math at University College Cork, Ireland (then: Queens College). Boole dedicated his life to understanding the human mind and with this diligentness, was able to apply mathematical ideas to logic to create Boolean Algebra and Symbolic Logic.
